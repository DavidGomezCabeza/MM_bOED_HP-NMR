# Inference for Stan model: PyrCompRepr_OED3_Try1_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(2000,2000,2000,2000); warmup=(1000,1000,1000,1000); thin=(1,1,1,1); 12000 iterations saved.
# 
# Warmup took (275765, 272754, 262900, 260223) seconds, 298 hours total
# Sampling took (576569, 669561, 486104, 625832) seconds, 655 hours total
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
