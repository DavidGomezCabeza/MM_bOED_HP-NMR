# Inference for Stan model: PyrCompRepr_OED3_Try2_model
# 10 chains: each with iter=(800,800,800,800,800,800,800,800,800,800); warmup=(400,400,400,400,400,400,400,400,400,400); thin=(1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1); 12000 iterations saved.
# 
# Warmup took (95784, 97317, 95563, 98108, 97054, 96362, 97180, 93484, 95292, 97244) seconds, 268 hours total
# Sampling took (215087, 230272, 236075, 213046, 205044, 197056, 204285, 182982, 170225, 222052) seconds, 577 hours total
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
