# Inference for Stan model: PyrCompReprFP_OED3_Try1_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(2000,2000,2000,2000); warmup=(1000,1000,1000,1000); thin=(1,1,1,1); 12000 iterations saved.
# 
# Warmup took (18719, 17704, 17370, 17229) seconds, 20 hours total
# Sampling took (28011, 25822, 25423, 26805) seconds, 29 hours total
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
