# Inference for Stan model: PyrCompRepr_Rand1_Try1_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(2000,2000,2000,2000); warmup=(1000,1000,1000,1000); thin=(1,1,1,1); 12000 iterations saved.
# 
# Warmup took (103017, 95264, 102578, 114111) seconds, 115 hours total
# Sampling took (160914, 182275, 223547, 213816) seconds, 217 hours total
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
