-  ***GenerateAverageData***: Notebook to generate average data from experiment traces for the experiments considering only 3.2 mM pyruvate with changing conditions (number of cells, membrane integrity and CO2 availability). The code also extrapolates the HP-Pyruvate concentration at t=0 (mixing of pyruvate with cells) from its T1 decay value. 
- ***PlotRawData***: Notebook to plot raw data traces for experiments. 
- ***VisualiseControlsHP***: Notebook to extract and plot the mean and standard deviation for the control experiments (0 mM pyruvate and 0 cells at 3.2 mM pyruvate).
