# Inference for Stan model: PyrMichMent_Try2_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(2000,2000,2000,2000); warmup=(1000,1000,1000,1000); thin=(1,1,1,1); 12000 iterations saved.
# 
# Warmup took (5863, 5857, 6038, 6003) seconds, 6.6 hours total
# Sampling took (14243, 14054, 13603, 14332) seconds, 16 hours total
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
