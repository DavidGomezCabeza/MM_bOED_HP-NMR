# Inference for Stan model: PyrNoTransport_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(2000,2000,2000,2000); warmup=(1000,1000,1000,1000); thin=(1,1,1,1); 12000 iterations saved.
# 
# Warmup took (149, 123, 116, 149) seconds, 9.0 minutes total
# Sampling took (278, 97, 199, 101) seconds, 11 minutes total
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
